# SP500 in 2022

This notebook studies the current losses of the S&P 500 index during 2022. Although I study data since 1985, the latest fall is only comparable to those in this century. I aim to answer the simple question: When will I get back the money I've lost this year? I study the behavior of the index using monthly prices and caveat for the current inflation and fed funds rate environment.
